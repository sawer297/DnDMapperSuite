# DnDMapperSuite
A tool suite for DMs

when creating branches, please follow the following naming conventions

# Maps
when working on the Map editing section start the branch with an 'M'
followed by one of the following letters;
- P - point plotting systems
- E - edge toggling systems
- O - option systems (doors, min/max elevation, chests)
- S - saving system

then add a "-" with a three digit number starting at 001
if the branch is to be used for testing purposes please add a 't' to the end
so a branch working on the Map Point plotting system would be MP-001

# Campaigns
when working on the Campaign editing section start the branch with a 'C'
followed by one of the following letters;
- M - maps and linking maps together
- P - players mechanics
- E - enemy mechanics
- I - Interactables (traps, items, doors)
- R - remote access

then add a "-" with a three digit number starting at 001
if the branch is to be used for testing purposes please add a 't' to the end
so a branch working on the campaign player mechanic system would be CP-001

once your make a branch, please increment the number here so that that other coders can see what numbers are to be used next
